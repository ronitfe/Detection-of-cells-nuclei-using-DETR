# Detection of  cellsâ€™ nuclei using DETR

This package contains the source code necessary to run the material described in 'Detection of cells nuclei with DETR' paper, which is the final project for a course on Deep Learning in Medical Imaging.

This paper have 3 projects: YOLO, FAST R-CNN and the main implementation - DETR.

The data is taken from the Kaggle data-science-bowl-2018 competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data

To run the code the data has to sit in the same main directory under stage1_train
& stage1_test
